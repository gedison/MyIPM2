Use a sanitation program to manage overwintering inoculum.<br \/><br \/>2. Use a multi-site fungicide in every spray. These include (most commonly) FRAC groups M3 and M4 - captan and mancozeb. Also copper and sulfur.<br \/><br \/>3. Alternate between site-specific fungicides from different FRAC groups (e.g. 3, 7, 9 and 11).<br \/><br \/>4. Use the highest labeled rate and do not practice alternate row middle spraying. This will best prevent pathogen escapes.<br \/><br \/>5.

When possible, avoid using any single-site fungicides from the same FRAC group more than twice in a season.<br \/><br \/>7.

    "content": "Fungicide resistance, defined as reduced fungicide sensitivity in fungal populations, is a real and serious threat in MA and most cranberry-growing region where fruit rot is a problem. In a disease complex with more than 12 fungal pathogens and limited fungicides available, it is critical to incorporate fungicide resistance management guidelines when planning fruit rot fungicide programs. Repeated and inadequate use of certain fungicides can accelerate the development of resistant pathogen populations and once this occurs, fungicide applications will provide very little or no disease control.<br \/><br \/>Newer fungicides, such as azoxystrobin, fenbuconazole, and prothiaconazole, were registered for use on cranberry relatively recently. These chemistries can be highly effective in controlling fruit rot fungi and are considered as less harmful to human and environmental health when compared to older chemicals, such as mancozeb and chlorothalonil. However, these newer fungicides have a <strong>single-site mode of action<\/strong>, which poses a much higher risk<strong> <\/strong>of selecting for fungicide-resistant pathogens than older fungicides with a <strong>multi-site mode of action<\/strong> (e.g., chlorothalonil and mancozeb). In order to preserve the effectiveness and durability of fungicides such as Abound, Indar, and Proline, it is <strong>CRITICAL<\/strong> to incorporate the fungicide resistance management strategies listed below:<br \/>Follow ALL label instructions, including application interval and recommended rate. Never use less than the lowest recommended rate on the label.<br \/>Alternate or mix fungicides with different modes of action.<br \/>Use FRAC codes on labels to determine mode of action. Same FRAC codes indicate that fungicides have the same mode of action. For example, Indar and Proline have a different trade name and active ingredient, but they have the SAME mode of action and FRAC code (3).<br \/>For best fruit rot control and fungicide resistance management, mix Abound with Indar or Proline.<br \/>Apply Indar\/Abound and Proline\/Abound during bloom period and use multi-site contact fungicides (chlorothalonil or mancozeb) in later applications.",
