The Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) is a formula created to provide growers with data regarding the environmental and health impacts of their pesticide options. Field EIQ factors in active ingredient, formulations, frequency of application and rate per acre and contains consumer, worker and environmental components. Consumer EIQ is defined as the sum of consumer exposure potential plus the potential groundwater effects. Worker exposure risk is defined as the sum of applicator exposure plus picker exposure times long-term health effect or chronic toxicity and environmental risk is composed of aquatic and terrestrial effects: the sum of the effects of the chemicals on fish, birds, bees, and beneficial arthropods. The higher the value, the higher the toxicity. The authors of MyIPM chose to display all toxicity numbers under 20 in green to indicate what we believe qualify as reduced risk&trade; values. For simplicity reasons we display Field EIQ values in the active ingredient and trade name tables.<br \/>Reference: Kovach, J., Petzoldt, C., Degni, J., and Tette, J. 1992.
