Always consult the label to verify if you are permitted to use the fungicide in your state!!!<br \/><br \/><strong>Pesticide Risk Assessment.<\/strong> The <a href=\"https:\/\/pesticiderisk.org\/\">Pesticide Risk Tool<\/a> (PRT) is an innovative on-line tool for growers, advisors, IPM and sustainability program managers and others to evaluate pesticide products and uses for impacts on aquatic, avian, small mammal and soil life, beneficials including pollinators, and worker and consumer health and safety. The tool applies the best available science to identify options with the fewest potential environmental and health risks, identify mitigation options for products\/uses selected, and estimate\/report progress in reducing risks. Data included in the MyIPM app reflect a periodic data export from the Pesticide Risk Tool; the app does not interface in real time.&nbsp; Pesticide Risk Tool outputs are calculated by considering the pesticide active ingredient, chemical formulation, application rate, application method and equipment, duration of restricted-entry interval (REI), average hours worked by field workers, and consider if gloves were worn or not.&nbsp; Data displayed in MyIPM tables are generated with apples as the default crop.&nbsp; Insecticide, fungicide and miticide applications presume use of an airblast sprayer; herbicides are default as foliar-applied using a boom sprayer. Pesticide Risk Tool human indices presume no gloves are worn and field crews work an eight-hour day.&nbsp; If these default scenarios do not match your application, risk scores may not apply. MyIPM risk scores will be updated periodically including after Pesticide Risk Tool database updates.&nbsp; You may set your own use parameters for pesticide applications by accessing the Pesticide Risk Tool at www.pesticiderisk.org. Output MyIPM reflect a database update generated on 10\/17\/17.<br \/><br \/><strong>Abbreviations:<\/strong><br \/><strong>FRAC<\/strong>: Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.frac.info\">www.FRAC.info<\/a>). FRAC codes describe a chemical class of fungicides with a common mode of action and are color coded in MyIPM. For example, FRAC code 11 or short FRAC 11 is coded green and so are the active ingredients that belong to FRAC 11 such as pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin, and trifloxystrobin.<br \/><br \/><strong>Disclaimer:<\/strong><br \/>The recommendations, results, and data contained in MyIPM are provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any kind either express or implied, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.<br \/>Recommendations are based on information from the manufacturer&#39;s label and performance data from research and Extension field tests.
