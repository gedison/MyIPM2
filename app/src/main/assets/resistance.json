Under permanent selection pressure, resistant insects outnumber susceptible ones and the insecticide is no longer effective. The speed of resistance development depends on several factors, including how fast the insects reproduce, the migration and host range of the pest, the availability of nearby susceptible populations, the persistence and specificity of the crop protection product, and the rate, timing and number of applications made. Resistance increases fastest in situations such as greenhouses, where insects or mites reproduce quickly, there is little or no immigration of susceptible individuals and the user may spray frequently.<br \/><br \/><strong>What insecticides are less likely to develop resistance?<\/strong><br \/>Resistance proof insecticides have yet to be developed. However, the speed of resistance development varies and depends on several factors, including how fast the insects reproduce, the migration and host range of the pest, the availability of nearby susceptible populations, the persistence and specificity of the insecticide, and the rate, timing and number of applications made.<br \/><br \/><strong>What can I do to reduce the risk of resistance development?<\/strong><br \/>Growers can help delay the development of resistance by applying insecticides only when they are needed, by rotating between different chemical classes, and by using rates of insecticides within the labeled range. Integrating non-chemical approaches such as cultural, behavioral, and biological controls can also help delay resistance.","fruitID":17,"affectionTypeID":2,"placement":1},{"id":2,"title":"Do I really need to worry about fungicide resistance?","content":"The simple answer is yes. Fungicides have become an integral part of efficient food production. The loss of a fungicide to agriculture through resistance may lead to unexpected and costly crop losses. All fungicides (except for the multisites like captan and thiram) are vulnerable to resistance development. Most resistance is based on point mutations in the target genes, which make the fungicides completely ineffective. Examples include resistance to Topsin M, Pristine, and Elevate. Resistance may establish in your farm and may make certain fungicide classes useless.
