The introduction of single-site fungicides including dodine and the methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) in the 1950s, the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBIs) in the 1980s, anilinopyrimidines (APs) in the 1990s, and the quinone-outside inhibitors (QoIs) in the 1990s allowed growers to continue to pursue post-infection application paradigms for apple scab management. Unfortunately, frequent reliance on single-site fungicides lead to a succession of resistance to each newly introduced fungicide class in the United States from the 1950s to the present. In apple scab populations east of the Mississippi, the AP fungicides, the DMI fungicide difenoconazole released in 2010, and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides released after 2012 (i.e. penthiopyrad, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and benzovindiflupyr) are only fungicides to which resistance has not been reported at the time of this app. In the face of resistance, apple growers are relying on applications of the multi-site, broad-spectrum protectant fungicides at five to seven day intervals. Such practices have led to increased problems with other fungal foliar diseases that are not easily managed with captan mancozeb. These include apple powdery mildew, cedar apple rust, and <em>Glomerella<\/em> leaf spot. The status of fungicide resistance in the aforementioned pathogens is largely unknown.<br \/><br \/><strong>Antibiotic Resistance in the Fire Blight pathogen <\/strong><em><strong>Erwinina amylovora<\/strong><\/em><strong>. <\/strong>the antibiotics, oxytetracycline can effectively manage blossom blight in semi-arid climates of the western United States, but the effectiveness of oxytetracycline&rsquo;s bacteriostatic mode of action is limited in the temperate production regions of the eastern United States. The aminoglycoside antibiotics streptomycin and kasugamycin are the most effective means of blossom blight control. The effectiveness of streptomycin is enhanced by its local systemic activity, and this regard, there are no other products offering a similar cost-effectiveness. Kasugamycin, registered for use on apples by the EPA in 2015 (EPA Reg. No. 66330-404), has similar level of efficacy against fire blight, but does not have local systemic activity like streptomycin. Streptomycin has been successfully used in the United States for nearly 50 years and is still used successfully in apple production operations in the eastern United States. However, reports streptomycin resistance throughout the United States have raised concerns about the continued use of this antibiotic for blossom blight. Streptomycin resistance has been confirmed for <em>E. amylovora <\/em>in California Washington, Oregon, Missouri, Michigan, and New York. In New York, strains of streptomycin resistant <em>E. amylovora <\/em>were localized operations in western New York, were promptly eradicated, and are no longer recovered in survey efforts after 2013. It is possible that isolates of streptomycin resistant <em>E. amylovora<\/em> are present in other apple production regions of the eastern United States. However, there have no systematic surveys of fire blight outbreaks in east beyond those conducted by Michigan and NY.","fruitID":17,"affectionTypeID":1,"placement":1},{"id":9,"title":"Situation in the Eastern USA","content":"There are no known major issues with resistance to fungicides in pear disease (scab, fabraea) management, however, rotation of fungicide types is always recommended.

The primary reason is the fact that historically insecticides have not been frequently used to control insect pests in blueberries.

Now frequent insecticides applications are made to control SWD which means that the risk of resistance development in SWD exists.
