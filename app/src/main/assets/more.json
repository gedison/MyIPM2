Affected leaves and tissue will turn brown and a diagnostic feature is that the tissue will easily give way from the crown when pulled. Under cool wet conditions B cinerea will colonize strawberry tissue just above the crown and leaves will begin to turn brown and die above the colonized region.

In the case of symptomless leaf infections, as the infected strawberry leaf begins to die, the pathogen goes into an active stage, colonizing the leaf and obtaining its nutrients from the dead tissue.

Botrytis crown rot is worse in years when early bloom occurs and this bloom is winter-killed. The pathogen colonizes the flower and then grows down into the crown tissue.

The edges of the patches are irregular in shape and affected areas reveal a complete loss (perhaps due to oxidation of epidermal cells) of yellow and red pigments. Soon after cold storage the cells underneath the fruit skin start to decay and patches sink slightly into the fruit. Symptoms in the field are rather unambiguous and for the untrained eye of little concern. In some areas of the fruit the trichomes appear brighter and are more showy. These areas of the fruit skin transform into what we call bronzing.<br \/><br \/><strong>Occurrence<\/strong><br \/>Bronzing symptoms have been observed postharvest since the 1970s, but incidence varies between almost non-existent to causing major postharvest yield losses. In South Carolina, bronzing is observed in years with above average rainfall in July. Varieties mostly affected include mid-season varieties such as Julyprince, Scarletprince, Redglobe, and Sweet Dream. Bronzing has been reported in California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and South Carolina and I have seen it on peaches from Spain indicating this is not just a US problem.<br \/><br \/><strong>Cause<\/strong><br \/>There have been many speculations around the cause of bronzing of peach skin. Speculations included early season thrip damage, the use of captan too close to harvest, the use of oil-based EC formulations, the application of certain fungicides, generation of abrasion due to handling of fruit during harvest, and pH or chemical reactions with hydrocooling water. Over time, however, none of these speculations held up with observations. We have not been able to isolate a microorganism from the patches.<br \/>Our research shows that bronzing is initiated prior to harvest and rapid cooling accacerbates but does not cause bronzing. New evidence based on symptom patterns found in the field suggest a physiological cause. We observed at medium severity bronzing patches to center around the equatorial plane (see picture gallery) of the fruit as well as in circles around the very top and the very bottom. Those are the areas of the fruit that expand the fastest during maturation. In some circumstances the entire equatorial plane become sunken. We hypothesize that too much water during periods of high transpiration may cause stress in form of water (nutrient?) imbalance to the fastest growing cells of the fruit (equator, top and bottom of fruit) that lead to cell collapse: In years with above average rainfall virtually all growers have problems with bronzing.

Some heavy metals in combination with abrasion (including the disturbance of the peach fuzz) will destroy peach cells of the peach skin containing pigments such as anthocyanins. That is what causes the dark color.\u00a0 His research shows that especially aluminum, copper and iron are culprits of inking. They can come from a variety of sources like dust (fine dirt particles that drift onto trees) overhead irrigation, hydrocooler water, fungicides, insecticides, etc. Contrary to the intuitive thought that water would wash off the metals, rainfall or overhead irrigation may increase inking, as it washes metals, dust, etc. to the fruit from the leaves. Iron (Fe) levels above 250 ppm in water will cause direct inking, but you will not likely see Fe levels this high in well water.\u00a0 With abrasion, Fe levels greater than 10 ppm will cause inking.\u00a0 Well and hydrocooler water should be checked as part of any investigation of inking. The levels are not researched as well, but levels greater than 50 ppm for Aluminum (Al) and Copper (Cu) will also cause inking when abrasion is added.<br \/>Here are some commercially available materials that contain unusually high levels of inking-causing heavy metals (for a more detailed list of heavy metal contents in Ag products click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/extension\/horticulture\/fruit_vegetable\/peach\/diseases\/pdf\/2009crisosto_inking.pdf\"><strong>here<\/strong><\/a>):<br \/>Foliar nutrients: Micro Plex (Fe)<br \/>Insecticides: Imidan (Al), Delegate (Al)<br \/>Miticides: Vendex (Fe and Al), Acramite (Fe and Al), Omite (Al)<br \/>Fungicides: Elite (AL)<br \/><br \/>Keep in mind that the availability of heavy metals is dependent on the pH of the spray solution, the type and concentration of ligands on which the metal could adsorb, and the oxidation stage of the heavy metal.

These enlarge to 1\/8 to 1\/4 inch in diameter and become red-brown to brown. By then, spots show brown on the undersides of leaves, and during wet periods tiny, whitish, feltlike patches appear in their centers. These contain the spores (conidia) of the causal fungus. On sweet cherry leaves the spots tend to be somewhat larger. Some spots may drop out, leaving a shotholed appearance. After the leaves become infected, they turn yellow and fall. When defoliation occurs before harvest, the fruit fails to mature normally, remaining light-colored and low in soluble solids.

The primary cycle begins by the fungus overwintering in diseased leaves on the ground, similar to apple scab. Around bloom or shortly afterward, sexual spores (ascospores) mature and are forcibly discharged during wet periods. They are carried upward by wind and splashing rain to infect young, expanded leaves where infection takes place through the stomates on the undersides. These first infections are often so few in number that they may be overlooked. Most spores are discharged from bloom to four to six weeks after petal fall. Low temperatures during spring can limit infection. Small, purplish spots appear on the upper leaf surfaces in about 10 to 14 days after the first infections. The incubation period from the first infection to the appearance of spots varies with temperature and can occur in as little as five days. Temperatures of 60 to 68 F (16-20 C) with rain or fog are most favorable for disease development; the lowest temperature range includes 41 to 46 F. The secondary cycle occurs when conidia from the feltlike centers of spots on leaf undersides mature 10 to 15 days after the first infections. Conidia appear as whiteish-pink sticky masses of spores can be observed on the underside of the leaf and are spread by rain.

On mature fruit, a red halo may appear around these lesions and will be most evident on fruit with yellow-colored skin. Once the size of the lesion reaches 1-3 cm diameter, fungal fruiting bodies called acervuli are produced in concentric circles around the point of infection. Under humid conditions, salmon colored conidia are produced from acervuli and are visible on the surface of the fruit. When conditions are dry, conidia will appear crystalline. As infected fruit ripen, the rotted flesh will become watery and take on a narrow, v-shaped appearance extending to the apple core. Fruit with severe bitter rot infections will either drop prematurely or will shrivel up and remain on the tree as mummified fruit.<br \/><br \/>Bitter rot lesions caused primarily by <em>C. gloeosporioides<\/em> may remain small and dark brown throughout harvest.

Pseudomonas syringae survives and grows on the surface of many different plant species and is distributed by splashing rain and by insects. Severe outbreaks of blossom blast on pears are usually associated with spring frosts because frost injury provides entry sites for infection. In the Columbia County (NY) orchards I observed, many of the developing fruitlets had frost rings, indicating that fruit were damaged by a frost (probably on May 14). However, less than 5% of the flower clusters were affected by blast.<br \/><br \/>Symptoms of blossom blast include blackening of the calyx end of individual fruitlets, blackening of entire blossom clusters with cluster leaves remaining unaffected, or complete death of clusters including both the blossoms and the leaves. Young leaves near affected clusters may have small nondescript necrotic leaf spots. Unlike fire blight, blossom blast does not spread into larger limbs or cause extensive damage to pear trees. However, heavy infections can seriously reduce fruit set.<br \/><br \/>In its early stages, when clusters of blossoms are just beginning to turn black, blossom blast can easily be confused with fire blight. However, symptoms of blossom blast are likely to appear earlier in the season than would be expected for fire blighted blossoms. (The expected appearance of blossom blight symptoms associated with fire blight can be determined using the MaryBlyt program.) Fire blight bacteria produce a toxin that is rapidly transported to adjacent leaves and causes blackening of leaf veins, whereas perfectly healthy leaves are often found just below clusters of flowers killed by blossom blast. Clusters affected by fire blight frequently have drops of bacteria ooze on their surface, sometimes visible only with a hand lens, whereas ooze is not visible with blossom blast.

Fruit infections are the most destructive. Infected blossoms wilt, turn brown and persist into summer. Outbreaks of brown rot are more common on mature than immature fruit. Initially, small, circular, light brown spots develop on the surface of the fruit and expand rapidly under favorable conditions, destroying the entire fruit. Rotted fruit may fall to the ground or persist as mummies on the tree. Under wet and humid conditions, ash-gray tufts bearing conidia of the fungus develop over the surface of infected tissues. The presence of conidia on lesions is the most distinctive characteristic of brown rot.<br \/><br \/><strong>Disease Cycle<\/strong><br \/>Sources of inoculum for blossom blight are overwintering brown rot-infected mummies, cankers, and, infrequently, apothecia (saucer-like, spore bearing fruiting bodies) from mummies on the orchard floor. Overwintering of the brown rot fungus in twig cankers is more common on peach, nectarine and apricot than on cherry. Conidia from mummies and other sources are disseminated by splashing or wind-driven rain, and spores discharged from apothecia during rain are carried by wind to blossoms. Infection of the blossoms depends on the duration of wetness and temperature. The hours of wetting necessary for blossom infection decrease from 18 hours at 50 degrees F to 5 hours at 77 degrees F. Infection proceeds slowly above 80 degrees F and below 55 degrees F (minimum 40 degrees F).<br \/><br \/>The potential for brown rot infection increases as the fruit mature. Infection occurs directly through the cuticle, through natural openings in fruit and through wounds. Injured fruit, such as sweet cherries cracked from rain, are particularly susceptible to infection. Brown rot mummies, infected blossoms, nonabscised aborted fruit, thinned fruit on the orchard floor and fruit infected during the growing season are inoculum sources for fruit infection. The level of inoculum is an important factor governing the severity of brown rot outbreaks on fruit. Warm, wet, humid weather lasting 2 to 3 days favors sporulation; long dry periods inhibit sporulation. Decay of the fruit and subsequent conidial produciton may occur in a few days, so the disease can build up rapidly.<br \/><br \/>(Source: Diseases of Tree Fruits in the East; A.L. Jones and T. B.

Typical vinegar flies infest damaged, overripe or rotting fruit for egg-laying, but a female SWD can lay eggs into intact fruit using its serrated ovipositor. Although the fruit receives some damage during egg insertion which increases its vulnerability to fruit pathogens, the majority of the damage is caused by larval feeding. The SWD larvae eat the fruit pulp causing fruit to collapse often within days of egg-laying. Figures 5A-L clearly demonstrate progression of SWD damage from oviposition to complete collapse of a blueberry. Because SWD attacks commercially-viable fruit, SWD poses a significant risk for blueberry growers. If SWD is not managed properly, fruit infested with SWD larvae may be harvested which will result in either downgrading or rejection of the entire shipment. It is therefore extremely important that Georgia blueberry growers implement effective monitoring and management strategies to minimize the impact of this devastating pest.<br \/><br \/><strong>Insect Life Cycle<\/strong><br \/>Eggs are laid in or on ripening fruits and hatch in 1 to 2.5 days.

Adults are 2-3mm in size and have a lifespan of 21-66 days (summer generations). Female SWD have a darkly toothed saw-like ovipositor. Males have a spot on each wing and dark bands located on their forelegs.","chemical":"Timely insecticide applications effectively manage SWD populations within the field. Currently there is no economic threshold set for SWD, and the benefits of treatment significantly outweigh the cost of application. A conservative approach is recommended for effective control. When implementing chemical control methods, choose from among the insecticides that have been shown to be effective against SWD. Fruits become susceptible to SWD once fruit coloration has started (when blueberries turn from green to purple). Treatment programs should begin as soon as the berries start to change color and continue through the end of harvest. Before administering pesticides growers should make sure their sprayers are calibrated and functioning properly. When administering pesticides, growers should ensure they are providing thorough coverage to the fruit and all areas of the bush. Selection of insecticides for SWD control in blueberries, take into account the efficacy, chemical class, harvest date, pre-harvest interval, re-entry restrictions, and your target markets. The level of control achieved will depend on the SWD population, timeliness of application, coverage of fruit, and product effectiveness. If you are exporting fruit, also check carefully on the maximum residue limits (MRL) for the destination country. Make sure to rotate classes of insecticides to delay the development of insecticide resistance.","fungicide":"Insecticide resistance has not yet been reported in any of the insect pests of blueberries in southeastern United States. The primary reason is the fact that historically insecticides have not been frequently used to control insect pests in blueberries. However, the recent introduction of invasive fly pest commonly known as spotted wing drosophila (SWD) has changed the situation. Now frequent insecticides applications are made to control SWD which means that the risk of resistance development in SWD exists. It is therefore important for blueberry growers to follow rotational strategies by selecting an insecticide from a different mode of action class at every application in a particular field.","biological":"<strong>Cultural Control<\/strong><br \/>Cultural control strategies should be part of the overall SWD management program and include sanitation, frequent harvest intervals, and exclusion netting. Sanitation, one of the most important cultural control methods, consists of removing over-ripe or fallen fruit from the field and disposing of them properly. Another sanitation method is the removal of wild plants that can be potential hosts for SWD including wild plants with berries such as grapes, beautyberry, elderberry, pokeweed, pokeberry, honey suckle, nightshade, dogwood, spicebush, and autumn olive, but the exact role of this approach in SWD control programs has yet to be investigated. Furthermore, frequent harvest intervals can keep susceptible fruit off of the bushes. During peak SWD season, harvest can be 1-2 times per week. Lastly, netting with mesh size less than .98mm can also protect the blueberry bushes from SWD. Small-scale growers or organic growers, due to their limited amount of control options, can utilize the mesh netting method to reduce SWD infestation.<br \/><br \/>If infested berries are found in the field or at the processor, they should be bagged inside plastic bags to prevent fly escape and placed in the sun to kill SWD before they complete development and emerge to continue infesting more fruit. If there is a large pile of fruit, it can be solarized by placing clear plastic sheet over the fruit in a sunny location and sealing well around the edge using soil. The infested fruit may be buried in the soil to prevent emergence, however, it will be effective only if burial depth is at least 30 cm or more otherwise flies can survive in the cool soil and emerge. Freezing berries is another way to kill SWD, and refrigerating them will stop further development of larvae, and may kill them after long periods of refrigeration.

In addition, Azalea bark scale (<em>Eriococcus azaleae<\/em>) and Lecanium scale (<em>Lecanium spp.<\/em>) are reported as to infest blueberry plants in Oregon. Although scale insects are not always considered a serious pest to blueberry plants, heavy infestation can significantly reduce the plant vigor and decrease berry yield. Different types of scale insects can be distinguished by the shape and color of the protective shell. The terrapin scale secretes brown or reddish brown covering over its body which round and rigid. The black bands present on the covering makes it look like the shell of a turtle. The protective shell of Putnam scale is round and rigid but brownish gray whereas the cottony cushion scale produces a white, waxy covering that is close to oval shape.

However, blueberry gall midge infestations can be detected prior to the onset of symptoms by collecting bud samples and using emergence traps and panel traps. For bud sampling, collect five young buds from 10-15 randomly selected bushes per acre. Place the buds into a zip-lock bag at room temperature. If buds are infested, reddish-orange larvae will begin to emerge after 3-4 days. The emergence traps made up of an overturned bucket with a sticky transparent window at the top can be used to detect gall midge populations earlier in the season. These traps can also be used to predict peaks in larval infestation, which is important for targeting pesticide application. Panel traps consisting of 1ft x 1 ft sticky panel attached to a metal or wooden post can also be used to detect midge adults.<br><br><b>Insect Life Cycle<\/b><br>Adults are very small and fragile flies, approximately 2-3 mm long. Adult flies have long slender legs, globular cylindrical antennae, and transparent wings with long black hair-like structures and reduced venation. Females lay eggs in floral or vegetative buds just after bud swell, as soon as scales of flower buds begin to separate and the tips of flowers become visible. Totally dormant buds are not infested. The adult stage probably lasts only for a few days (less than a week) during which time a single female can lay up to 20 eggs. Eggs hatch in 2-3 days. First instar larvae are less than 1 mm long, white and almost transparent. They then go through three instars and develop into mature larvae in about 7-10 days. The full-grown larvae are about 1mm long, 0.3 mm wide, legless, and reddish-orange in color. Once fully fed, the larvae cease feeding, come out of the buds and drop to the ground to pupate in soil. The puparia transform into adult flies in a few days. In South Georgia, gall midges can complete 5-6 generations from January through June. Earlier in the season, midge larvae feed on floral bud tissues and on the pedicels that hold the individual flower buds to the peduncle within the developing flower cluster. As a result, flower buds dry up and disintegrate within about two weeks after infestation. Depending on severity of infestation, high levels of flower bud abortion (as high as 80%) may occur. Although both rabbiteye and southern highbush blueberries are susceptible to blueberry gall midge, the impact of gall midge infestation is relatively less on early blooming cultivars of southern highbush because of the earlier timing of floral bud development. Later in the season, as plants progress to vegetative budding, oviposition also occurs on the new shoot meristems. Infested vegetative buds swell and the outer leaves curl enfolding feeding larvae inside. Vegetative meristems may also be infested and killed leading to distorted and blackened shoot tips, characteristic symptoms of damage caused by gall midge. The damage caused by gall midge in blueberries might be confused with frost damage or boron deficiency. The severity of damage depends on temperature and other climatic factors, and generally tends to be worse after mild winters.","chemical":"The blueberry gall midge larvae are very difficult to kill using insecticides because they are protected by surrounding plant tissue while feeding inside the buds.

On nectarines and plums, adult damage consists of tiny circular feeding punctures or small crescent-shaped oviposition wounds made by females immediately adjacent to egg-laying punctures. On peaches, it is more common to see a 1\/8-inch area of shiny fuzz. Teasing away the fuzz will expose a feeding or oviposition scar, possibly an oval white egg or brown larval tunnel into the flesh. These feeding and oviposition sites cause conspicuous scarring and malformation as the fruit develop and can provide entry for the brown rot fungus. Feeding damage by adults appears obscure in April but, as the fruit enlarges, plum curculio feeding looks like the injuries caused by catfacing insects or cold. The larvae tunnel and feed in developing fruit, usually boring to the pit. Most peaches infested by plum curculio early in the season drop prematurely. Female curculios will deposit eggs whenever fruits are available, but they prefer small, young peaches or peaches within two weeks of harvest. Larger peaches, infested after pit hardening begins, generally stay on the tree until ripe, but these wormy fruit are of no value due to the flesh damage and\/or presence of the grubs<br \/><br \/><strong>Insect Life Cycle:<\/strong><br \/>Plum curculio is a snout beetle native to North America and is found east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. Plum curculio overwinters as an adult in ground litter or other protected places, both in and around orchards, particularly in nearby woods or fence rows. Overwintered adults become active when mean temperatures reach 50F to 60F for three to four days, and begin moving toward orchards when the maximum temperature reaches 70F for two or more days. This series of temperature events often takes place shortly before or as peaches bloom, especially in the middle and upper South.<br \/><br \/>Initially, overwintered adults feed on succulent buds, foliage, and blooms. A pre-oviposition period following emergence from hibernation may vary from six to seventeen days, depending upon temperature. As the most mature peaches reach shuck split, the female begins depositing eggs singly in a hole that she eats in the fruit. The egg hatches on average in about five days. The larva feeds in the fruit for eight to twenty-two days. The full-grown larva tunnels out of the peach, enters the soil and constructs a small earthen cell, usually one to three inches below the surface. After about two weeks, the larva transforms into a white pupa, then to an adult. First generation adults usually emerge about four weeks after larvae enter the soil. The complete life cycle, from egg to emerged adult, requires five to eight weeks, depending upon climatic conditions. In the Southeast, there are usually two generations and possibly a partial third generation each year.<br \/><br \/>Emerging overwintered adults may deposit eggs (first generation eggs) as soon as young peaches reach shuck split. Emergence and oviposition may continue for a period of six to eight weeks following shuck split. The next adult emergence (first generation adults) usually occurs from late May through July. These adults begin egg laying (second generation eggs) in early June. Second generation larvae may be found in peaches at harvest time. Second generation adults normally appear in late July or August. Both first and second generation adults feed on foliage or fruit until cool weather, when they seek overwintering sites.","chemical":"Plum curculio is the key fruit-infesting insect pest of southeastern peaches. Its lengthy emergence and egg-laying periods mandate diligent control, but existing control programs work well and plum curculio is seldom damaging in well-managed orchards. Adult populations are suppressed in the spring by well-timed applications of effective insecticides. Sprays provide a protective barrier to prevent overwintering adults from laying first generation eggs. Sprays for plum curculio control are normally initiated at shuck split. Two or three additional sprays at 10- to 14-day intervals are needed to assure control of the overwintered population. Sprays targeting the overwintered plum curculio generation also provide control of oriental fruit moth and suppress stink bugs moving into the orchard. If the egg-laying adults are not effectively controlled, additional applications will be necessary to prevent wormy fruit from second generation larvae that mature from early June through harvest. In infested orchards, special attention should be given to mid- and late-season cultivars by applying insecticide sprays at six, four, and two weeks before harvest.<br \/><br \/>An improved knowledge of plum curculio biology is allowing greater refinement of control efforts. Once maximum daily temperatures reach 70<sup>o<\/sup>F for two consecutive days from February to early March (Florida or Georgia) or March to early April (Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, North Carolina), begin accumulating daily degree days (DD). At pink stage, position two to four pyramid traps per block in the outer row of peach trees adjacent to woodlots or fence rows. At petal fall, begin checking pyramid traps twice weekly for plum curculio adults. At the same time, inspect 100 fruit along the orchard perimeter for plum curculio feeding damage. After accumulating 50 to 100 DD (approximately shuck split), growers should expect to start catching plum curculio adults in pyramid traps or see the first feeding damage on fruit. An insecticide application is recommended if the traps exceed 0.1 adults per trap per day or if damage exceeds 1%. Adult emergence can also be monitored by jarring peach trees along the perimeter over a ground sheet or beating tray. Jar trees in the early morning when the plum curculio adults are less active and more easily dislodged. Migration of adults into the orchard continues from 50 to 500 DD, so this is the period when fruit should be protected by insecticide sprays (most of March in Florida and southern Georgia, most of April in the central Georgia and more northern areas). Summer adults emerge from the soil after 1,000 DD (from sometime in late May through harvest).","fungicide":"Not currently an issue, but rotation of chemical classes should be used in order to reduce risk of resistance developing.","biological":"Keeping the orchard floor closely mowed after harvest affords less protective cover to adults that overwinter in the orchard.

In peaches, feeding damage can cause leaf chlorosis and twig or limb die-back, even death of trees if scale populations reach high levels. Feeding injury to peach fruit (primarily from San Jose scale) produces small, red, measles-like lesions on the skin.<br \/><br \/><strong>Insect Life Cycle:<\/strong><br \/>White peach scale overwinter primarily as fertilized females beneath scale coverings. Overwintering females begin laying eggs in February and March. They first lay orange-colored eggs that will become females, then pinkish eggs, which will become males. Eggs are laid underneath the scale covering. Each female lays 100 to 150 eggs, usually over an 8 to 15 day period. Eggs hatch within two to five days.<br \/><br \/>Upon hatching, crawlers immediately leave the protection of the parent scale and move to new sites to settle. Crawlers frequently do not move far from their parent, some even anchor under the parent scale. Male white peach scale crawlers locate in clusters on older, lower portions of the tree. Female crawlers are generally more active than male crawlers and may disperse throughout the tree, although they are seldom seen on terminal, green wood, or fruit. Crawlers soon anchor at a new site, insert their slender mouthparts and begin to feed. About seven to nine days after hatching from the eggs, anchored crawlers molt and begin forming their own scale covering. The scale covering is cemented firmly to the bark and is relatively impermeable.<br \/><br \/>A third molt gives rise to the adults. Adult females remain under their scale throughout their life. Winged adult males emerge from beneath their scales, seek out females, and mate. Males do not feed and die shortly after mating. Mated females soon begin to lay eggs. Females usually die following oviposition. A complete white peach scale generation, from egg to egg, takes 50 days at 75<sup>o<\/sup>F. Developmental time is temperature dependent and varies considerably in the field.","chemical":"The mainstay of control is application of two dormant oil treatments ideally at two-week intervals. Additionally, well-timed insecticide applications aimed at the unprotected crawlers provide good control. Both methods should be used where white peach scale infestations are chronic or heavy.<br \/><br \/>Crawlers are unarmored and susceptible to insecticides for only seven to nine days, so identifying the periods of egg hatch and crawler activity is critical to the proper timing of crawler sprays. These periods vary with season and location. To monitor crawler emergence of either white peach scale, find a limb heavily infested with scale, wrap the limb with double- sided sticky tape or black electrical tape coated with petroleum jelly. When crawler emergence begins, the tiny crawlers will be caught crossing the tape. Monitor tapes twice weekly. With a hand lens, crawlers are easily seen against the tape. Spray as soon as feasible after you find scale crawlers. If emergence continues, spray again a week later. Thorough coverage is essential. Dilute airblast application with at least 150 gals\/acre will work, but handgun application does a better job, especially against white peach scale.<br \/><br \/>Two or more crawler generations may develop each year after harvest. Make special efforts to detect and control these late season crawlers. Crawlers of the third generation are known to be very important in the spread of white peach scale. In middle Georgia, the August borer spray normally provides an important component of overall white peach scale control. In south Georgia, borers should be treated immediately after harvest. A special scale treatment applied between mid-September and late October is very valuable for scale and helps with borer control. Always monitor for crawlers and time sprays accordingly. If post-harvest crawler generations are not controlled, a heavy scale infestation may be carried into the winter, making control even more difficult the following year.<br \/><br \/>Spray coverage is also critical for good control.

Masses of accumulating gumming, frass, and bark chips at the base of the tree are often the first evidence of infestation. Several larvae may develop in one tree. Young trees are particularly susceptible to borers; when infested they are generally week and grow poorly.

Moths are active during the day, and mating pairs are not an uncommon sight in infested orchards. Females normally mate and begin to lay eggs within a few hours after emerging. Each female lays 200 to 800 reddish-brown eggs. They are usually laid singly in cracks, under loose bark, near wounds, or other rough areas on tree trunks.

Eggs are usually laid singly in cracks in the bark, frequently in the crotch. Females seem to prefer laying their eggs around wounds or injuries such as sunscald, winter injury, mechanical injury, broken or cracked limbs, Cytospora cankers, or existing borer infestations. Eggs hatch in one to three weeks, depending upon temperature. Upon hatching, young larvae immediately bore into the bark. Larvae find it more difficult to establish in healthy undamaged bark.

It is possible for scale crawlers to be wind blown into orchards from adjacent hedgerows, wooded borders, or orchards. Within one day after emerging, crawlers settle, insert their mouthparts into a host, and begin to feed. Within two to three days of settling, crawlers begin to secrete their protective coating. There are four or more generations of San Jose scale per year in much of the southeast. San Jose scale has a very high reproductive potential. Serious infestations can develop between harvest and the onset of winter. This is especially true when abundant late-summer rainfall promotes succulent growth favorable for scale development.","chemical":"Trees and fruit should be inspected frequently for the presence of scale insects. Scales blend in well with peach bark and are generally hard to see. Controls are suggested when scale lesions were present on fruit the previous year or when scales are found on wood during pruning.
